# Starting Something

Hey there! 

The team at [Splatspace][splatspace] has been excited about this challenge since we heard of it. Even before we knew whether or not we had been picked for the challenge, people were signing on to form our Hackerspace Challenge team and throwing out ideas for what we could do.

Now that we've got a team working and some ideas going strong, we thought it would be good to say hello and introduce ourselves.

## Splatspace

Splatspace is a really young hackerspace (we've been around for less than a year) in Durham, NC, which is one corner of the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina. We've got a good mix of electronics folks, programmers, and fabricators, and we've already embarked on a fair number of projects together.

The thing that has already risen to dominate the character of our space is education--we regularly hold classes to teach soldering and electronics to members who want to learn more and the general public, and we're collaborating with other groups to start new classes we can offer the community. With such a focus on teaching new skills, we were all very excited to take part in [element14's][element14] education challenge.

## Our Team

Our team is composed of electronics folks, microcontroller folks, a fabricator or two, some programmers, and some media people. They are:

* Justis Peters: Project management, Arduino programming 
* Alan Dipert: Programmer, CAD design
* JC Sackett: Media, Programmer
* Skippy Hope: Programmer
* Jeff Crews: Fabrication, CAD design
* Peter Reintjes: Electronics, Hardware
* Mike Broome: Programmer, Electronics
* Dino Segovis: Fabrication, Electronics, CAD design
* Darren Boss: Programmer, Media
* Ashley Dipert: Programmer
* Tom Billman: 

We'll have more on our team in a later post!

# Projects

**Let a thousand flowers bloom...**

Our early brainstorming revealed a number of small, elegant ideas, and we realized early on that rather than talking the topic of what to settle on to death, we would do much better to let a number of projects get going. Consider it a small intraspace challenge--the winner in a week or two will become the project we all pursue wholeheartedly for the remainder of the challenge. And we'll all be happy with it, because we'll know it's one that's already survived a challenge.

Here's what we're looking at so far.

## Music player

Music education often gets overlooked, but it's still very important. It can be difficult to introduce musical concepts to children without teaching them a lot of motor skills first--anyone who learned to play the piano as a child can no doubt remember learning to hit a chord at high speed being as difficult as just reading the music.

The music player, protoyped here by Peter Reintjes, gets around this difficulty by making the creation of music as easy placing magnets on a refrigerator.

## Numeric blocks

This idea seems to be a popular one with hackerspaces! Similar to other teams, we're looking at a set of blocks that dock with each other and a master control block. The control block can set them up to do a variety of things like cluster into groups to teach fractions and sets, or aid in the teaching of arithmetic.

## Gravity ball

Have you ever tried to explain physics to elementary school students? It's not easy. That whole notion of force, acceleration, and the rest just isn't that intuitive. The gravity ball (not necessarily the final name) uses an accelerometer and LEDs to help illustrate these concepts in a hands-on way for young students, letting them see the force and acceleration as they throw a ball around or drop it and bounce it off of things.

# That's all for now

So, there you have it, the quick thumbnail portrait of who we are and what we're doing. We'll have some fleshing out of these ideas and how we selected them in some posts that are coming up soon. Keep reading!
