Hey all!

As we mentioned in our [last post][winner], we selected the piano player as our real, honest to goodness, totally awesome, Great Global Hackerspace Challenge project.

Since then, Jeff Crews has created a fine enclosure, and Peter Reintjes and Alan Dipert have really gotten the software in excellent shape.

Rather than me blabbering on for another page, we thought it would be best to show you all a video.

In addition, Ashley McTK has put together [a great site][gghc site] for the piano player, with lesson plans, schematics, and other information.

<p>We've got photos of the final Piano player (as well as other photos from the last six weeks) available [on flickr][flickr].</p>

The code running the Piano player is available on [github][github].
